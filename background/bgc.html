                    Ahmedabad is the largest city in the state of Gujarat. It is located in western India on the banks
                    of the River Sabarmati. The city served as political as well as economical capital of the region
                    since its establishment. The earliest settlement can be recorded around the 12th century under
                    Chaulukya dynasty rule. The present city was founded on 26 February 1411 and announced as the
                    capital on 4 March 1411 by Ahmed Shah I of Gujarat Sultanate as a new capital. Under the rule of
                    sultanate (1411–1511) the city prospered followed by decline (1511–1572) when the capital was
                    transferred to Champaner. For next 135 years (1572–1707), the city renewed greatness under the early
                    rulers of Mughal Empire. The city suffered due to political instability (1707–1817) under late
                    Mughal rulers followed by joint rule between Maratha and Mughal. The city further suffered following
                    joint Maratha rule.

                    The story is that the king, by the aid of the saint Shaikh Ahmad Khattu, called up the prophet
                    Elijah or Khidr, and from him got leave to build a city if he could find four Ahmads who had never
                    missed the afternoon prayer. A search over Gujarat yielded two, the saint was the third, and the
                    king the fourth. The four Ahmads are said to have been helped by twelve Babas; these were Baba
                    Khoju, Baba Laru, and Baba Karamal, buried at Dholka; Baba Ali Sher and Baba Mahmud buried at
                    Sarkhej; a second Baba Ali Sher who used to sit stark naked; Baba Tavakkul buried in the Nasirabad

                    were never re-peopled. The excessive greed of the Marathas as sole rulers of Ahmedabad caused great
